      question: "I don’t know my Gotra, what should I do?",
      answer: "We would first suggest you to consult elders in your family to gather more information about your Gotra. If at all, no one in your family remembers the Gotra information, you can follow the guidance of the Shastras. As per the Shastras, if someone doesn’t know their Gotra they can consider their Gotra as Kashyap Gotra. So you can mention Kashyap Gotra in your Sankalpa form while completing the booking and proceed with your booking. Hari Aum."
